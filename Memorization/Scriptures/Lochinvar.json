"},
            {"text": "He stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone,<br />He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;<br />But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,<br />The bride had consented, the gallant came late:<br />For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,<br />Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar. "},
            {"text": "So boldly he entered the Netherby Hall,<br />Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers and all:<br />Then spoke the brides father, his hand on his sword,<br />(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)<br />&#39;Oh! come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,<br />Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?&#39;"},

            {"text": "So stately his form, and so lovely her face,<br />That never a hall such a galliard did grace;<br />While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,<br />And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;<br />And the bride-maidens whispered, &#39;Twere better by far<br />To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.&#39;"},
