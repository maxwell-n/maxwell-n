<h1>Time Signatures</h1>
<hr/>
<P>Time signatures define the meter of the music. Music is "marked off" in
    uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the
    number of beats in each. This is not necessarily intended to indicate which
    beats are emphasized, however. A time signature that conveys information about
    the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to
    suggest, but only <I>suggest</I>, prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.</P>

        <TD width=*><B>Specific time</B><BR>The bottom number represents the note
            value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the
            crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note
            values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is
            the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). You would
            pronounce this as "Three Four Time", and was referred to as a "perfect"
            time.

            tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values
            within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that
            120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many
            publishers precede the marking with letters "<B>M.M.</B>", referring to
            <SPAN class=mw-redirect>Maelzel</SPAN>'s
            Metronome.
