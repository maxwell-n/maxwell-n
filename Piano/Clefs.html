<h1>Clefs</h1>
<hr/>
<P>Clefs define the pitch range, or tessitura, of the staff on which it is
    placed. A clef is usually the <I>leftmost</I> symbol on a staff. Additional
    clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for
    instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of
    several lines on a staff.</P>

            Positioned here, it assigns G above middle C to the <I>second line from
                the bottom</I> of the staff, and is referred to as the "treble clef." This
            is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for
            most modern vocal music. Middle-C is the 1st ledger line below the stave
            here. The shape of the clef comes from a stylised upper-case-G.

        <TD width=*><B><SPAN class=mw-redirect>C clef</SPAN> (Alto Clef and Tenor

            middle C, or approximately <SPAN class=internal>262 Hz</SPAN>. Positioned
            here, it makes the <I>center line on the staff</I> middle C, and is
            referred to as the "alto clef." This clef is used in modern notation for
            the viola. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate
            various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a "movable" clef:
            it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a
            "tenor clef". This clef is used very often in music written for bassoon,
            cello, and trombone; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger
            lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading. Both the alto and tenor
            clefs are used in traditional <SPAN class=mw-redirect>choral</SPAN>
            scores.

                from the top</I> of the staff F below middle C, and is called a "bass
            clef." This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in
            choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C
            is the 1st ledger line above the stave here. The shape of the clef comes
            from a stylised upper-case-F (which used to be written the reverse of the
            modern F)

            eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves
            respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used,
            often used instead of a C clef for tenor lines in choral
            scores.

</TABLE>
<P><B>Tablature</B><BR>For guitars and other plucked instruments it is possible
    to notate tablature in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB-sign is
    often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not
    necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for
    standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show
    on which fret the string should be played. This Tab-sign, like the Percussion
    clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a
    clef. The interstitial spaces on a tablature are never used.</P>
