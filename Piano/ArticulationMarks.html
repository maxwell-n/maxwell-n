<h1>Articulation Marks</h1>
<hr/>

<P>Articulations (or accents) specify how individual notes are to be performed
    within a phrase or passage. They can be fine-tuned by combining more than one
    such symbol over or under a note. They may also appear in conjunction with
    phrasing marks listed above.</P>

        <TD width=*><B>Staccato</B><BR>This indicates that the note is to be
            played shorter than notated, usually half the value, the rest of the
            metric value is then silent. Staccato marks may thus appear on notes of
            any value, thus shortening their actual performed duration without
            speeding up the music itself.

        <TD width=*><B>Staccatissimo</B><BR>Indicates a longer silence after the
            note (as described above), making the note very short. Usually applied to
            quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking�s meaning was more
            ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and
            sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now
            almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.)

        <TD width=*><B>Tenuto</B><BR>This symbol has several meanings. It usually
            indicates that it be played for its full value, or slightly longer. It may
            indicate a separate attack on the note, or may indicate legato, in
            contrast to the dot of staccato. Combining a tenuto with a staccato dot
            indicates a slightly detaching ("portato" or "mezzo staccato").

            note is to be played "open" (without lowering any valve). In organ music,
            this denotes that a pedal note is to be played with the heel.

            instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward. On a plucked
            string instrument played with a plectrum or pick (such as a guitar played
            pickstyle or a mandolin), the note is played with an upstroke. In organ
            notation, this marking indicates to play the pedal note with the
            toe.

            with a plectrum or pick (such as a guitar played pickstyle or a mandolin),
