        <TD width=*><B>Tremolo</B><BR>A rapidly-repeated note. If the tremolo is
            between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number
            of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes)
            indicates the frequency at which the note is to be repeated (or
            alternated). As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver
            (thirty-second note) rate.
            <P>In percussion notation, tremolos are used to indicate rolls, <SPAN
                    class=mw-redirect>diddles</SPAN>, and <SPAN
                    class=mw-redirect>drags</SPAN>. Typically, a single tremolo line on a
                sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a
                combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a <SPAN
                        class=mw-redirect>double-stroke roll</SPAN> (or a <SPAN
                        class=mw-redirect>single-stroke roll</SPAN>, in the case of timpani) for a
                period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the
                interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by
                the director and performers.</P></TD>
