        <TD width=*><B>Tie</B><BR>Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined
            together are to be played as one note with the time values added together.
            To be a tie, the notes must be identical; that is, they must be on the
            same line or the same space; otherwise, it is a slur (see below).

        <TD width=*><B>Slur</B><BR>Indicates that two or more notes are to be
            played in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on
            instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if
            played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate
            that the notes are to be played legato; in this case, rearticulation is
            permitted.
            <P>Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable
                because it always joins exactly two immediate adjacent notes of the same
                pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches.</P>

            <P>A <I>phrase mark</I> (or more uncommonly, <I>ligature</I>) is a mark
                that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over
                several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not
                necessarily require that the music be slurred.</P></TD>

            between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted
            string instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously
            (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet
            instruments will blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes
            to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).
