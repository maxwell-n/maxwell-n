        <TD width=*><B>Staff, Stave</B><BR>The fundamental latticework of music
            notation, upon which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four
            intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the diatonic scale - which
            pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the clef. With
            treble clef, the bottom staff line is assigned to E above <SPAN
                    class=mw-redirect>middle C</SPAN> (E4 in note-octave notation); the space
            above it is F4, and so on. The <SPAN class=mw-redirect>grand staff</SPAN>
            combines bass and treble staffs into one system joined by a brace. It is
            used for keyboard and harp music. The lines on a basic five-line staff are
            designated a number from one to five, the bottom line being the first one
            and the top line being the fifth. The spaces between the lines are, in the
            same fashion, numbered from one to four. In music education, for the
            Treble Clef, the mnemonic "Every Good Boy Does Fine" (or "Every Good Boy
            Deserves Food") is used to remember the value of each line from bottom to
            top. The interstitial spaces are often remembered as spelling the word
            "face" (notes F-A-C-E).
