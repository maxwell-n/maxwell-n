<h1>Key Signatures</h1>
<hr/>
<P>Key signatures define the prevailing key of the music that follows, thus
    avoiding the use of accidentals for many notes. If no key signature appears, the
    key is assumed to be C major/A minor, but can also signify a neutral key,
    employing individual accidentals as required for each note. The key signature
    examples shown here are described as they would appear on a <I>treble</I>
    staff.</P>

            Different keys are defined by the number of flats in the key signature,
            starting with the leftmost, i.e., B&#9837;, and proceeding to the right; for
            example, if only the first two flats are used, the key is B&#9837; major/G
            minor, and all B's and E's are "flattened", i.e. lowered to B&#9837; and
            E&#9837;.

            Different keys are defined by the number of sharps in the key signature,
            also proceeding from left to right; for example, if only the first four
            sharps are used, the key is E major/C&#9839; minor, and the corresponding
            pitches are raised.
