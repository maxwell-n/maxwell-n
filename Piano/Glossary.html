        minuet)
    </LI>
    <LI><B>attacca</B>: attack, or go on; i.e., at the end of a movement, a

        instructs the musicians to remove their mutes); see also <SPAN
                class=mw-redirect>Sordina</SPAN>. <B>Note:</B> <B>sordina</B>, with plural
        <B>sordine</B>, is strictly correct Italian, but the forms <B>con sordino</B>
        and <B>con sordini</B> are much more commonly used as terms in music.
    </LI>
    <LI><B><SPAN class=mw-redirect>con sordino</SPAN></B>, or <B>con sordini</B>
        (plural) (incorrect Italian): see <B>con sordina</B>, above

    <LI><B><SPAN class=mw-redirect>cut time</SPAN></B>: Same as the meter 2/2: two
        half-note (minim) beats per measure. Notated and executed like <SPAN
                class=mw-redirect>common time</SPAN> (4/4), except with the beat lengths
        doubled. Indicated by three quarters of a circle with a vertical line through
        it, which resembles the cent symbol '<B>¢'</B>. This comes from a literal cut
        of the '<B>C'</B> symbol of <SPAN class=mw-redirect>common time</SPAN>. Thus,
        a quarter note in cut time is only half a beat long, and a measure has only
        two beats. See also <SPAN class=mw-redirect>alla breve</SPAN>.

        used for string instruments, since with them another means of execution is
        often possible. (The return from <B>divisi</B> is marked <B>unisono</B>: see
        in this list.)

        players perform tremolo with the bow by rapidly moving the bow while the arm
        is tense. It can also be intended (inaccurately) to refer to vibrato, which is
        a slight undulation in pitch. It is notated by a strong diagonal bar across
