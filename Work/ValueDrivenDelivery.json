Even safety and regulatory compliance projects can be expressed in terms of business value by considering the business risk and impact of not undertaking them. If value then is the reason for doing projects, value driven delivery is the focus of the project throughout the project planning, execution, and control processes.

      "explanation": "In waterfall it can be a long time before a product is ready for release. In Agile this can be shorter, sometimes only a few weeks. This serves to reduce project risk because the customer receives the most important features very early on in the process. As the project comes to its deadline the team is typically working to deliver far less important features that in many cases could be excluded if required without impacting business value. This puts the customer in a position to make the decision as to whether or not they want the desired features without of loosing the critical value."
